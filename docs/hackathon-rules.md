## Code and Submission Rules

### Prior Code Policy

### Features and Additions
- Your submission may be a feature or addition to a larger project (not recommended)
- Submissions must stand alone from anything produced prior to the hackathon
- Cannot be simple iterative improvements (e.g., just adding AI across a product)
- Can be something like an MCP server enabling an agent to complete a novel task

### Presentation Guidelines
If your submission is part of a larger project:
- You may briefly demo the larger project for context
- Maximum 1/3 of presentation time on prior work
- You will only be judged on the standalone portion created during the hackathon
- Your submission will not benefit from being part of a larger project

## Repository Requirements
